			       	<h4>Crop Prediction</h4>
			       	<p class="para" align="justify">Crop forecasting or prediction is the art of predicting crop yields and production before the harvest actually takes place, typically a couple of months in advance. Crop forecasting relies on computer programs that describe the plant-environment interactions in quantitative terms.The soil testing program starts with the collection of a soil sample from a field. The first basic principle of soil testing is that a field can be sampled in such a way that chemical analysis of the soil sample will accurately reflect the field’s true nutrient status. The purpose of soil testing in high-yield farming is to determine the relative ability of a soil to supply crop nutrients during a particular growing season, to determine the needs, and for diagnosing problems such as excessive salinity or alkalinity. Soil testing is also used to guide nutrient management decisions related to manure and sludge application with the objective of maximizing economic/agronomic benefits while minimizing the potential for negative impacts on water quality. </p>

		    	<p class="para" align="justify">Nowsdays farmers facing lots of problems and they don’t know the proper information regarding crops to grow and to cultivate. In agriculture field, farmer has to know about the suitable crops for cultivation. Growing crops are completely based on the type of the soil and its features, location, whether etc. Now a days analyzing soil and its features are entirely manual which requires more time. This leads to the development of the automation for crop prediction based on the soil features.</p>
