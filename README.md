1.It is crucial for the farmers to know what all different types of crops can be cultivated in his/her land so as to get good crop quality and yield. 
2.As current system is the manual system which needs more time, experience and proper judgements which may lead to less crop yield and loss to farmers. 

3.There are important relationship between different types of crops so as to get better crop yields. As we do not have the proper system to find the cropping patters, we require a automation for cropping patterns prediction to help farmers to grow better crops types for better yield and profits.

Drawbacks of Existing System :

Only crop prediction not cropping patterns prediction

Manual process

Previous results and experience considered

Leads to wrong estimations.

Loss to farmers

Less crop yield

No real time implementations done
